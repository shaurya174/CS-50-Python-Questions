# CS-50-Python-Questions
In this repository, i am solving the questions of CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python in my own way.
1. Indoor Voice -> indoor.py -> In a file called indoor.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input in lowercase. Punctuation and whitespace should be outputted unchanged. You’re welcome, but not required, to prompt the user explicitly, as by passing a str of your own as an argument to input.
2. Playback Speed -> playback.py -> In a file called playback.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for input and then outputs that same input, replacing each space with ... (i.e., three periods).
3. Making Faces -> faces.py -> In a file called faces.py, implement a function called convert that accepts a str as input and returns that same input with any :) converted to 🙂 (otherwise known as a slightly smiling face) and any :( converted to 🙁 (otherwise known as a slightly frowning face). All other text should be returned unchanged.
4. Einstein -> einstein.py -> In a file called einstein.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for mass as an integer (in kilograms) and then outputs the equivalent number of Joules as an integer. Assume that the user will input an integer.
5. Tip Calculator ->tip.py -> This is link to the problem https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/0/tip/
6. Deep Thought -> deep.py -> In deep.py, implement a program that prompts the user for the answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything, outputting Yes if the user inputs 42 or (case-insensitively) forty-two or forty two. Otherwise output No.
7. Home Federal Savings Bank -> bank.py -> In a file called bank.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a greeting. If the greeting starts with “hello”, output $0. If the greeting starts with an “h” (but not “hello”), output $20. Otherwise, output $100. Ignore any leading whitespace in the user’s greeting, and treat the user’s greeting case-insensitively.
8. File Extensions -> extensions.py -> Link to problem  https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/1/extensions/#demo 
9. Math Interpreter -> interpreter.py -> Link to problem https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/1/interpreter/
10. Meal Time -> meal.py -> Suppose that you’re in a country where it’s customary to eat breakfast between 7:00 and 8:00, lunch between 12:00 and 13:00, and dinner between 18:00 and 19:00. Wouldn’t it be nice if you had a program that could tell you what to eat when? In meal.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a time and outputs whether it’s breakfast time, lunch time, or dinner time. If it’s not time for a meal, don’t output anything at all. Assume that the user’s input will be formatted in 24-hour time as #:## or ##:##. And assume that each meal’s time range is inclusive. For instance, whether it’s 7:00, 7:01, 7:59, or 8:00, or anytime in between, it’s time for breakfast.
11. camelCase -> camel.py -> In a file called camel.py, implement a program that prompts the user for the name of a variable in camel case and outputs the corresponding name in snake case. Assume that the user’s input will indeed be in camel case.
12. Coke Machine -> coke.py -> In a file called coke.py, implement a program that prompts the user to insert a coin, one at a time, each time informing the user of the amount due. Once the user has inputted at least 50 cents, output how many cents in change the user is owed. Assume that the user will only input integers, and ignore any integer that isn’t an accepted denomination.
13. Just setting up my twttr -> twttr.py -> When texting or tweeting, it’s not uncommon to shorten words to save time or space, as by omitting vowels, much like Twitter was originally called twttr. In a file called twttr.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a str of text and then outputs that same text but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.
14. Vanity Plates -> plates.py ->Link To The Problem ->  https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/psets/2/plates/
15. Nutrition Facts -> nutrition.py -> In a file called nutrition.py, implement a program that prompts consumers users to input a fruit (case-insensitively) and then outputs the number of calories in one portion of that fruit, per the FDA’s poster for fruits, which is also available as text. Capitalization aside, assume that users will input fruits exactly as written in the poster (e.g., strawberries, not strawberry). Ignore any input that isn’t a fruit.
16. Fuel Gauge -> fuel.py -> In a file called fuel.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a fraction, formatted as X/Y, wherein each of X and Y is an integer, and then outputs, as a percentage rounded to the nearest integer, how much fuel is in the tank. If, though, 1% or less remains, output E instead to indicate that the tank is essentially empty. And if 99% or more remains, output F instead to indicate that the tank is essentially full.
If, though, X or Y is not an integer, X is greater than Y, or Y is 0, instead prompt the user again. (It is not necessary for Y to be Be sure to catch any exceptions like ValueError or ZeroDivisionError.
17. Felipe’s Taqueria -> taqueria.py -> In a file called taqueria.py, implement a program that enables a user to place an order, prompting them for items, one per line, until the user inputs control-d (which is a common way of ending one’s input to a program). After each inputted item, display the total cost of all items inputted thus far, prefixed with a dollar sign ($) and formatted to two decimal places. Treat the user’s input case insensitively. Ignore any input that isn’t an item. Assume that every item on the menu will be titlecased.
18. Grocery List -> grocery.py -> In a file called grocery.py, implement a program that prompts the user for items, one per line, until the user inputs control-d (which is a common way of ending one’s input to a program). Then output the user’s grocery list in all uppercase, sorted alphabetically by item, prefixing each line with the number of times the user inputted that item. No need to pluralize the items. Treat the user’s input case-insensitively.
